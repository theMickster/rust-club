🧙🏼‍♂️ **First rule of Rust: you don't talk about `unsafe` 🤘**

Welcome to **rust-club**—where the only thing more dangerous than `unsafe` code is a poorly placed semicolon! 🦀

## About This Repo

After over two decades of of engineering experience across a wild variety of apps, platforms, and languages, I've decided to take the plunge into the world of Rust. Why? 🤔 Because, I still like my code like I like my puns: safe, fast, and occasionally groan-worthy.

This repo is my open notebook as I learn Rust, experiment with its features, and (hopefully) avoid summoning any undefined behavior demons. Expect code samples, notes, and the occasional Fight Club reference—because every good engineer knows the value of a strong community and a little bit of mischief.

## What You'll Find Here

- My journey from Rust rookie to (eventual) Rustacean
- Code experiments, learning notes, and project ideas
- Puns, pop culture references, and a healthy respect for the borrow checker

## Why "rust-club"?

Because the first rule of learning Rust is: you *do* talk about Rust. (Just not about `unsafe`... unless you really have to.)
